# This is for course CSE 572 Data Mining Homework #1.

Question 2 of HW1 was to reproduce same code and outputs which is coming from link:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/preejababu/titanic-data-science-solutions

To reproduce this I have created git repo from github and cloned to my local machine
and generated small project setup to reproduced everything. The model accuracies were successfully 
reproduced and matched the Kaggle notebook results.

I used venv to keep code libs isolated.
I downloaded and uploaded all data .csv files to data folder in project folder.
I used requirements txt file for required libs to install.
.gitignore file has been added to remove venv file and all unnecessary files from project directory.

# To run:
1. Make sure you cloned git repo.
2. Make sure you have python installed your PC.
3. Install all required libs listed in requirement.txt file.
4. Open survival_prediction.ipynb and select your kernel from venv and run code.
5. Once run, latest csv output will be saved in data folder.
6. For question 2 optimized code is comes under survival_prediction_opt.ipynb script.
